# Rock-paper-scissors game

Old school (dates back to ancient Roman times) hand game. With this version you don’t even need hand. You know the rules. Press ‘Play!’, enter your name and play choosing one of three circle buttons in each move. Anybody who collects 10 points first, is a round winner. Would it be you?
